Subject: [PATCH 130/199] ARM: dts: imx6qdl-sabrelite: move phy reset to
 pinctrl_enet

This patch moves pin EIM_D23 (phy reset) from pinctrl_hog to pinctrl_enet.
It also explicitly sets the pad to 0x000b0.

Before this patch, it has the value 0x1b0b0 if using mainline u-boot.
So this patch also removes hysteresis and a 100K pullup since the pad
is always an output.
