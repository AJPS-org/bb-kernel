Subject: [PATCH 140/199] ARM: dts: imx6q: update setting of VDDARM_CAP voltage

According to datasheet, VDD_CACHE_CAP must not exceed VDDARM_CAP
by more than 200mV, as all of i.MX6Q boards' VDD_CACHE_CAP currently
are connected to VDDSOC_CAP, so we need to follow this rule by
increasing VDDARM_CAP's voltage.
